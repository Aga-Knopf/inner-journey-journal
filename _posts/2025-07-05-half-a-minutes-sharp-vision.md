Yesterday, on Friday 4th of July, I had a sharp vision flash (for my right eye) which lasted around 30 seconds, until I closed my eyes. The vision was clear and I could read 3 cm - sized letters clearly from 2 meters away. The impression was that I just can see unblurred image, although I had half-opened eyelid. Even if I could say that it's because of the eyelashes obstructing my vision or half-opened eyelid (as the ayurveda pinhole glasses might have the same effect) - it was not the case. First of all I've had only blurred image with semi-closed eyelid with that eye. 3 weeks ago I started having second long sharp vision flashes, and a series of them on Monday exercises. Before exercising, it never happened. The eye didn't even acomodate, not even an inch. It was immobile. Now it's beginning to accomodate to sharp vision, and can accomodate slightly (maybe from -3.25 to -3? or -2.75? hard to tell) all the time.

That day I woke up and gave my eyeballs a light massage. I've felt my eyeballs were pleasantly soft (they were always HARD, especially the -3.25 D one), and when I pressed them slightly down, they didn't hurt. They've hurt for over 20 years when I lightly pressed them down. 
A day before that I did my 45 minutes exercises on online classes (I attend them twice a week, on Mondays and Thursdays) - this time the focus was on sunset light & palming.
