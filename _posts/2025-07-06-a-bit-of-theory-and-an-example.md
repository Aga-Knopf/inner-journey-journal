[The Nervous System and Processing Information with Bonnie Bainbridge Cohen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MrFZNrY45ek&t=23s&ab_channel=BonnieBainbridgeCohen)

This is what I am doing to heal myself, for 5 years. And it's not easy, but it is healing.

This is a piece of this video that shows what I have noticed on myself many times. Last time, around 2 weeks ago, when I had a terrible headache which lasted for 2 days, I had a similar experience of healing it:
[A simple example how this works](https://youtu.be/MrFZNrY45ek?t=354)

My pain has also healed in a moment. When I understood I no longer need to hold anger and control myself, I let go - and thus I released the tension which caused me headache. 
I was angry because of my diet I don't eat sugar & lactose, so I couldn't ice cream and drink my favorite capuccino in a cafe. But how can I be angry if I myself decided to stay with my diet and I've felt better while on it? 

So I ate creme brulee ice cream and had a capuccino in a cafe. With the first spoon of ice cream - the pain was gone! 

I agreed to make exceptions a little more often, but I keep my diet. It makes me feel better. And I have internally communicated with the part of myself that really didn't wanted to be controlled. 

This is so simple.
And yet, it's not simple at all.

But it's great fun!
