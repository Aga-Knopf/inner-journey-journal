Yesterday, on Friday 4th of July, I had a sharp vision flash (for my right eye) which lasted around 30 seconds, until I closed my eyes. The vision was clear and I could read 3 cm - sized letters clearly from 2 meters away. The impression was that I just can see unblurred image, although I had half-opened eyelid. Even if I could say that it's because of the eyelashes obstructing my vision or half-opened eyelid (as the ayurveda pinhole glasses might have the same effect) - it was not the case. I've had seen only blurred image with semi-closed eyelid with that eye. 

3 weeks ago I started having second long sharp vision flashes, and a series of them on Monday exercises - they occured when I looked max to the right and I blinked. I was focusing on the image from right eye, the left eye was obstructed by my nose :-)).

Before exercising, until around 3 weeks ago, the sharp vision flashes from my right eye have never happened. The eye didn't acommodate at all, it did not react. It was immobile, focused on microscopic images and I was seeing sharp to an edge of 20 cm. Now it's beginning to accomodate up to sharp vision (I think no matter the distance), and can accomodate all the time from -3.25 to -3? or -2.75? - hard to tell how well, but it's gradually becoming flexible.

That day I woke up and gave my eyeballs a light massage. I've felt my eyeballs were pleasantly soft (they were always HARD, especially the -3.25 D one), and when I pressed them slightly down, they didn't hurt. They've hurt for over 20 years when I lightly pressed them down. 
A day before that I did my 45 minutes exercises on online classes (I attend them twice a week, on Mondays and Thursdays) - this time the focus was on sunset light & palming. 

For the record I began exercising my eyes on September 2024.
Before that I had spontanous sharp vision 2 months earlier - only with my stronger eye, -1D - I was occasionally seeing sharp when I was watching cartoons or driving. Or when I was at the gym. For a minute, for a few minutes, for a few seconds. It happened when I was really calm. 

I began calming myself down (without any medications - just by letting emotions go and trying my best to change my outlook at the world) a few years ago. The results of constantly working on it are gradually becoming visible as physical improvements - less headaches, less body tensions (the body is rarely stiff), droopy eyelids are gone, I have slightly better eyesight (better contrast & vivid colors, and the eyes are not 'jumpy'), better skin and hair.
