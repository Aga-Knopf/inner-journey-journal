2 days ago I made another step of getting to know the reason for my left-side tension and hopefully fixing it. I'd like to live in a relaxed state as my basic state instead.

It is an observable fact in some individuals who can see with both of their eyes at once (I use my right eye to see objects near me, and my left eye to see objects far away), that the eyes switch their activity. It is easy to notice if you close both of your eyelids, cover one eye with your palm, and direct your face onto the sun. You should see dimmed sunlight through your uncovered eyelid, and darknes with the other eye. The image which is then created should be alternating between dominant light and darkness. This way you can observe your rythm of changing the vision. Try to observe that your whole body works like this.

My brain would also work like that. But I'm not letting it work like that.

It has occured to me (after 5 years of watching myself very carefully - I hope to describe all that I was doing in the blog - perhaps someone would find this interesting, or maybe helpful!) - so it has occured to me, that my brain can't alternate. If it was to keep the rythm of alteration that my eyes sometimes (but not always) present, I **tense** the **left side of my body** to keep track of my thoughts, my constant analysis of everything around me. Because if I let that go, my thoughts vanish, I am present in the moment (boring! cleaning, cooking, working, doing dull stuff!) and my entertaining thoughts are gone... and I didn't want it to go for a very long time. It's like when I keep my non-stop focus longer than the switching (which only takes a few seconds), I need to be tense.

And also I block a lot of emotions in my left side, which I have done a lot of work on ... but that's a huge topic to cover. So they sit on the left side and hurt sometimes, too. Until I let them go.

This is all I have figured for 5 years of extensive research in the fields of osteopathy, bioenergetics (mostly Lowen), psychology ( I'm a fan of C.G. Jung, Gabor Mate, dr Hawkins, dr Radziszewska, B. Nelson, S. Litwinow - I should put my bibliography somewhere!). So that's the step that I believe is a huge milestone for me, to feel it, to realize it, to know it - I'm blocking my train of thoughts somehow. I mean, maybe that's how it's supposed to work - but the analysis is causing my tension - maybe I can't thing without the tension - or maybe they're just linked, and they don't have to be.

I believe I could think in a focused way without the tension. 

Figuring this out perhaps will be the next step?

We'll see!
