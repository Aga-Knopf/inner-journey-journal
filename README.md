# inner-journey-journal
I'm experiencing a sharp pain of the left side of my body for 5 years. After long research I've identified the cause of it, and I'm constantly working on resolving the cause! This is the journal of fixing my chronic tension pain, along with other body tensions and headaches with mental and emotional analysis of myself and reconfiguring my world view. And surprisingly, this also helps to fix postural issues and increase muscle strength even better than Pilates and other exercises! Works best when combined with diet, Pilates and "eye-yoga" exercises (an unique system of a local teacher).
