<h1>Hi, I’m Aga.</h1>
<h2>Welcome to my blog.</h2>
<section class="intro">
  <p>I’ve been experiencing a sharp pain on the left side of my body for five years.</p>
  <p>After extensive research, I identified its root cause and I’m actively working to resolve it. This journal documents:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>My process of fixing chronic tension pain</li>
    <li>Physical tensions and headaches analyzed through mental and emotional lenses</li>
    <li>Adjustments to my worldview and habits</li>
  </ul>

    I’m also exercising my eyes to improve my vision (L −1.00 D, R −3.25 D myopia; intermittent astigmatism). 
    These exercises surprisingly help correct postural issues and build muscle strength. Best effects are when they're combined with Pilates, massage and physiotherapy. And a decent diet.
